**写回和写通**

> 1. Write-through: When data is updated, it is written to both the cache and the back-end storage. 
>
>   This mode is easy for operation but is slow in data writing because data has to be written to both the cache and the storage.
>
> 2. Write-back: When data is updated, it is written only to the cache. The modified data is written to the back-end storage only when data is removed from the cache. 
>
>   This mode has fast data write speed but data will be lost if a power failure occurs before the updated data is written to the storage.
